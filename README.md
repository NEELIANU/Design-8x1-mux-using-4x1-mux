# Design-8x1-mux-using-4x1-mux
ðŸ”¹ Overview

A Multiplexer (MUX) is a digital circuit that selects one input from multiple inputs and forwards it to a single output line.
An 8x1 multiplexer has 8 input lines, 3 selection lines, and 1 output line.

Instead of designing it directly, it can be built using smaller multiplexers like the 4x1 MUX, showcasing hierarchical design and modularity in digital logic.

ðŸ”¹ Concept

A 4x1 MUX selects one out of 4 inputs using 2 selection lines.

By combining two 4x1 MUXes for the lower and upper set of inputs, and then using a third 2x1 multiplexer (or equivalent logic) to choose between them, we can construct an 8x1 multiplexer.

This method demonstrates how larger multiplexers can be implemented from smaller ones.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Implements 8x1 functionality using only 4x1 multiplexers.

Demonstrates modular design and circuit reusability.

Supports hierarchical modeling in Verilog.

ðŸ”¹ Applications

Data routing in digital systems

Control unit design in processors

Communication systems for channel selection

General-purpose digital logic design

ðŸ”¹ How It Works

Inputs are divided into two groups of 4.

Each group is fed into a 4x1 multiplexer, controlled by the lower 2 selection lines.

A third multiplexer selects between the outputs of the two 4x1 MUXes, based on the highest selection bit.

The result is an 8-input, 1-output multiplexer using only smaller building blocks.
